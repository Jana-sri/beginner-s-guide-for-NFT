# beginner-s-guide-for-NFT
This project aims to provide a comprehensive data-driven analysis of NFTs on OpenSea and Twitter datasets. By investigating sales trends and buyer behaviour, it explores the correlation between various factors, such as NFT categories (art, gaming, PFP, virtual world) and the type of crypto currency used for transactions, to identify optimal investment strategies.

Additionally, sentiment analysis of Twitter data reveals the impact of public opinion on NFT sales. Through this approach, we can determine the best categories to invest in, ideal investment timing, and how twitter dynamics influence NFT market performance. The findings will provide actionable insights for navigating the NFT market and selecting the right crypto currency for investments.
